# Looking Glass FORKED
Modern, simple and fresh looking glass based on Bootstrap 5 and PHP 8 (also compatible with 7). A looking glass is a network utility which is
made user-friendly for everyone to use. It allows you to execute network related commands within a remote network, usually that of an ISP.

I'm not a big fan of docker so I decided to make this fork to be free with a simple bash script that installs everything.
The project has been reworked to display Looking Glass only ipv6
